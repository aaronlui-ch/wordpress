Shortcode Whitelist for bbPress, BuddyPress and WordPress Comments.

== Description ==

Shortcodes in WordPress comments, BuddyPress activities, bbPress topics and replies are disabled as default.

For example, let’s say you have a calendar plugin that produces a browsable calendar, which you embed to a page with a shortcode. What if you want to publish this calendar in a sticky topic in a forum? The shortcode will not evaluated, so you will just see literally the shortcode…

DV Shortcode Whitelist plugin allows you to enable the shortcodes in these fields with ease. You can enable all shortcodes or create whitelists to allow specific shortcodes.

Also you can enable the shortcodes for specific user roles or capabilities. For example, you can only allow site admins and forum moderators to use shortcodes.

Easy to use plugin settings allow you to enable or disable everything separately in a few clicks.
